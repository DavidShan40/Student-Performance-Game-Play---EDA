# Student-Performance-Game-Play---EDA
Explaintory Data Analytics and Predicting modeling

# Summary
Dataset: A subset from the new Kaggle data competition. The dataset trace student learning from Jo Wilder online educational game. There are three question checkpoints (level 4, level 12, and level 22), each with a number of questions.

The two topics I want to consider are: explaintory data analytics and Predicting modeling. Exploratory Data Analysis involves examining and summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset to gain potential insights and issues. I want to check the missing value, clean the missing and wrong data, make some plots to discover more information from this dataset such as using histograms, boxplot, scatterplots and correlation plot. 

Predicting Modeling in this dataset identifying the level of the game, which helps the system to identify which level of the game the user is doing.

# Methods
MICE, GGpairs, Tree Plot, Confusion Matrix, Skewness, PCA, Lasso Regression
