# Student-Performance-Game-Play---EDA
Explaintory Data Analytics and Predicting modeling

# Summary
Dataset: A subset from the latest Kaggle data competition. The dataset tracks student learning progress in the Jo Wilder online educational game. It consists of three question checkpoints (levels 4, 12, and 22), each containing multiple questions.

The two topics to be considered are: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis involves scrutinizing and summarizing the primary attributes of a dataset to reveal potential insights and issues. In this context, EDA will entail checking for missing values, cleaning any missing or incorrect data, and creating various plots to derive more information from the dataset. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and correlation plots will be employed to better understand the data.

Predictive Modeling, in the context of this dataset, involves determining the game level the student is currently engaged in. By doing so, the system can accurately identify the appropriate level of difficulty for the user. This will help tailor the educational experience to the individual student, promoting better engagement and learning outcomes.
